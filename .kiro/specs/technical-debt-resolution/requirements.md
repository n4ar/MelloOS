# Requirements Document: Technical Debt Resolution

## Introduction

This specification addresses the systematic resolution of 149 TODO items identified in the MelloOS codebase. The technical debt spans multiple subsystems including memory management, filesystem, user/process management, syscalls, drivers, signals, devices, userspace programs, and tests. This effort will improve code quality, completeness, and maintainability while ensuring all deferred implementations are properly addressed.

## Glossary

- **Technical Debt**: Deferred implementation work marked with TODO comments that needs completion
- **MelloOS**: The custom operating system being developed
- **Subsystem**: A major functional area of the kernel (e.g., memory management, filesystem)
- **TODO Marker**: A comment indicating incomplete or deferred implementation
- **Integration Test**: End-to-end test verifying system behavior
- **Unit Test**: Test verifying individual component behavior

### Requirement 6: Signal TODO Resolution

**User Story:** As a signal handling developer, I want all signal TODOs resolved, so that signal delivery includes UID-based permission checks, kernel thread protection, and proper signal frame setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN signals are sent between processes, THE Signal System SHALL verify UID-based permissions when user management is implemented
2. WHEN signals target kernel threads, THE Signal System SHALL protect kernel threads from inappropriate signal delivery

2. WHEN PTY operations require process group information, THE Device System SHALL retrieve actual PGID from task structures
3. WHEN job control operations occur, THE Device System SHALL properly manage foreground and background process groups

### Requirement 8: Userspace Program TODO Resolution
