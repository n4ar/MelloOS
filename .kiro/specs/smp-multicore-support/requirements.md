# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for implementing Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) support in MelloOS kernel. The SMP feature enables the kernel to utilize multiple CPU cores simultaneously, distributing tasks across cores for improved performance and responsiveness. This phase builds upon the existing scheduler, syscall, and IPC infrastructure from Phase 4.
