# No Assumptions Policy - MANDATORY

## NEVER MAKE ASSUMPTIONS - STATE FACTS AND ASK

**This rule enforces the product constraint: "Avoid LLM hallucinations or assumptions"**

### REQUIRED BEHAVIOR:

When encountering missing dependencies, tools, or configuration:

❌ **DON'T DO:**
- Assume user preferences ("you might not want X because...")
- Dismiss issues as "expected" 
- Make judgments about what user needs
- Skip mentioning installation options

✅ **DO THIS:**
- State the objective fact: "X is not installed"
- Provide the exact command: "Run: `command here`"
- Ask directly: "Would you like me to install X?"
- Let user decide

### EXAMPLES:

❌ **Bad (assumption):**
"Microsoft Edge isn't installed, but that's expected since it's similar to Chrome"

✅ **Good (facts + ask):**
"Microsoft Edge is not installed. To install it, run: `npx playwright install msedge`. Would you like me to install it?"

### WHY THIS MATTERS:
- Respects user autonomy
- Prevents missed opportunities
- Maintains transparency
- Follows product constraints
- Avoids LLM hallucinations

### CONTEXT FRAMEWORK - ALWAYS APPLY:

Before responding to ANY technical issue, ask yourself:
1. **What are we working on?** (Project/task context)
2. **Why does this issue matter?** (Impact on the goal)
3. **What can't be done without fixing it?** (Consequences)
4. **What's the solution?** (Clear action needed)

### RESPONSE TEMPLATE:
"For [PROJECT/TASK], [ISSUE] is preventing [SPECIFIC IMPACT]. To fix this, run: `command`. Would you like me to [ACTION]?"

## ADDITIONAL SCENARIOS - MANDATORY

### 1. MISSING FILE OR PATH ERRORS:

❌ **Bad (assumption):**
"config.json might not be necessary depending on your setup..."

✅ **Good (facts + ask):**
"config.json was not found in the working directory. To generate it, run: `npx create-config`. Should I create it for you?"

### 2. UNKNOWN USER INTENTS OR TOOLS:

❌ **Bad (assumption):**
"I'll assume you're using React since it's common..."

✅ **Good (clarify first):**
"You mentioned a UI component, but the framework isn't specified. Are you using React, Vue, or something else?"

### 3. AMBIGUITY HANDLING:

**RULE:** If project/task context is ambiguous, always ask for clarification before continuing with code or instructions.

### 4. NO SILENT FALLBACKS:

**RULE:** Never fallback silently. If using a default, state it clearly and ask if acceptable.

✅ **Better approach (ask before acting):**
"No color palette was provided. I can use 'default.dark' or wait for your input. Should I proceed with 'default.dark'?"

## USER AUTONOMY PRINCIPLE

**Core Philosophy:**
- Always ask before taking action on behalf of the user
- Never mask decisions behind automation or assumptions  
- Build trust by exposing defaults, limits, and fallback logic
- Give users choice and control at every decision point

**REMEMBER: Always connect technical issues to project context and user goals.**
